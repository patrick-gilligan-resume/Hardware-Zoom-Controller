# Hardware-Zoom-Controller
This is a 9-key mechanical keyboard that I hacked the firmware so it can work with Zoom as a hardware controller. The code base is built in C, but there is an accompanying script written in node that when deployed, tracks the mute state of the conference and updates the color of the keyboard buttons accordingly, if the mic is muted, or if video is stopped.
